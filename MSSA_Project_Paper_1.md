The definition of a web application is an application program stored on a remote server and delivered over the internet through a browser interface. Web services are
included as web applications by definition, and many websites are considered web apps.However, the key difference between a web application and a website is that a web app
requires user interaction, while a website simply displays content. In this paper, I will go over several examples of web applications to illustrate this point. There are many different types of 
web applications such as online banking, marketplaces, social media such as twitter, movie streaming sites llkee
Netflix, and much more.

One example of a web application is Youtube. As far as what kinds of data are involved with 
Youtube, I will discuss a few of them here. Youtube deals mainly with the data within
the video/audio files it hosts along with user account information for users who
want to access features such as commenting, creating playlists/saving videos, and viewing history to help 
Youtube's algorithm suggest certain videos for you. Since Youtube has some premium options available, it also 
deals with payment information. In regards to user interface, youtube first takes you to your home page, which
will display your recommended videos, trending topics, etc. At the top is the search bar which then leads to 
lists of videos to search through. Each video has a sidebar with more recommended videos. In terms of programming logic, youtube
is mainly a video content hosting service. Content creators post videos that users can search through and watch. When you first get to
Youtube's home page, it uses your profile data to populate your home screen with recommended/trending videos. The program then waits for input to search for and select videos, the program 
retrieves relevant results. Once a video is selected, the program plays the video file.

Another web application is Microsoft Outlook. Outlook deals with profile data for each user, email addresses and 
other data involved with mailboxes, and sending mail between mail servers. User interface for Outlook is very similar
to other email services such as Gmail. After logging in, you are presented with all the necessary options needed to 
manage your emails. You have the main inbox where you can see incoming emails, junk/spam folder, sentbox, and more. There is also a section
that allows you to write and send emails. The programming logic for Outlook is first, Outlook authenticates the user, then connects them to their email server which 
gives them access to their services, then waits for the user to request the program to take actions either by opening/sending emails, or by executing other tasks such as
sorting or sending items to the trash, or searching through the inbox.

The third web application I will discuss is Amazon. Amazon is an online marketplace, so it deals with account information such as payment 
information, addresses, order history, and search history so it can make recommendations based on your habits. For the user interface, Amazon presents the user with different 
options for searching for items, one way is to use the menus to sort items by different categories eg.(video games/electronics), or you can use the search bar to manually enter searches.
First step for the programming logic is to use your account information to populate your homepage on Amazon with recommendations, then it will wait for the user to take 
action by searching for and selecting an item. Once an item is selected, the program will display the item page, which consists of different pictures, a detailed item description, and 
includes customer reviews. When a customer decides to buy the item and check out, it will prompt for payment and shipping information in order to calculate shipping and handling, as well
as the address to send to. Once confirmed and payment is accepted, the order is sent and processed by the seller.

In conclusion, there are many different types of web applications, only a few of which were discussed here. Most, but not all websites contain web applications. The key difference being that web applicqtions
require user input/interaction to complete some kind of function, while all a website does is display some form of content.
