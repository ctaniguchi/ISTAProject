For my project selection I have chosen to create a management tool for a blood bank.
This application will be an all-in-one tool to deal with daily operations such as blood
drives and managing transactions.

This application will deal with several kinds of data. The user will be able to input 
donor information such as basic contact and demographic information, and more detailed
information dealing with blood type, recorded transactions such as date/time of past donations.
Also the application would deal with data related to the blood supply on hand, including
the amount, and separating by blood type. 

For the user interface, the application will be a desktop application with a home page.
The homepage would consist of a searchbar with different textboxes, radio buttons, and dropdown menus
that will allow the user to filter their search queries. There will be an option to input information for new transactions such 
as new donations, or changes in blood supply on hand.The search function will return tables with rows
containing information related to donor information or the current blood supply of the blood bank. On the main
information page for each donor, there will be a textbox for the user to input any additional comments. 

In terms of programming logic, there are several steps for the application to take.
First, the application opens and takes the user to the home screen, which consists of the main menu
which provides options for the user to query information from the database using the search functionality.
The user then specifies the parameters for their search by using the dropdown menus, textboxes to retrieve their desired
information. Once the resulting rows are retrieved, the user can sort the rows by the different columns such as last name, or
blood type. The user can then get more information by clicking on a specific row that represents a specific transaction
that will bring up a more detailed information page.
